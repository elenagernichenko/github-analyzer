However, fonts like Segoe UI and San Francisco reserve invisible space for ascenders and descenders, causing text to appear visually lower than the center even when mathematically aligned.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, I implemented a solution using `transform` and `line-height`.\r\n\r\n## My Solution: `transform` + `line-height`\r\n\r\n### 1. `transform: translateY(-1px)` on the Label\r\n\r\n*   **Its Purpose** It moves the text up by 1 pixel at the compositor level.\r\n*   **Safety:** It does **not** trigger a layout recalculation (reflow). It does not change the height of the status bar. It does not affect the position of neighboring items. It is purely visual.\r\n*   **Fragility:** Low. It is an integer pixel shift, which renders cleanly on all screens (no sub-pixel blurring).\r\n\r\n### 2. `transform: translateY(1px)` on the Icon "

This includes:\n\n1. An `_isDisposed` flag to prevent multiple disposals\n2. A `trackDisposable(this)` call in the constructor for leak detection\n3. A `markAsDisposed(this)` call in the `dispose()` method\n\nSuggested implementation:\n```typescript\nclass DisposableCallback<T> implements IDisposable {\n\tprivate _cb: ((e: T) => void) | undefined;\n\tprivate _isDisposed = false;\n\n\tconstructor(cb: (e: T) => void) {\n\t\tthis._cb = cb;\n\t\ttrackDisposable(this);\n\t}\n\n\tdispose(): void {\n\t\tif (this._isDisposed) {\n\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t}\n\t\tthis._isDisposed = true;\n\t\tmarkAsDisposed(this);\n\t\tthis._cb = undefined;\n\t}\n\n\treadonly handler = (val: T) => {\n\t\treturn this._cb?.(val);\n\t};\n}\n```\n\nNote: You'll need to import `trackDisposable` and `markAsDisposed` from `vs/base/common/lifecycle.js`."

You're right - the issue is more fundamental than just the `ChatMultiDiffContentPart`.

I looked into the VS Code codebase to see how this kind of thing is typically handled.\r\n\r\n## What I found\r\n\r\nI searched through the existing logger creation patterns and filename sanitization in the codebase. A few things stood out:\r\n\r\n**How logger IDs become filenames:**\r\n\r\nIn `src/vs/platform/log/common/log.ts` (lines 653-655), when you pass a string ID, it goes straight into `joinPath()`:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nprotected toResource(idOrResource: string | URI): URI {\r\n    return isString(idOrResource) ? joinPath(this.logsHome, `${idOrResource}.log`) : idOrResource;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's no sanitization or encoding happening there. That's why we hit the Windows path error with characters like `:`, `/`, `?`.\r\n\r\n**Existing patterns:**\r\n\r\nLooking at 50+ logger creation calls across the codebase, they all use simple IDs like `'network'`, `'terminal'`, `'remoteagent'`. I couldn't find any examples of URLs or complex strings being used as "

The disposable should be scoped to the group's lifetime instead of being added to the main disposables store.\n\nConsider one of these approaches:\n1. Use a DisposableStore scoped to the group and dispose it when the group is removed via `onDidRemoveGroup`\n2. Use `Event.once(group.onWillDispose)` to dispose the listener when the group is disposed\n\nExample using pattern 2 (similar to editorService.ts):\n```typescript\nconst groupDisposable = group.onDidActiveEditorChange(() => {\n    if (group.count > 1) {\n        updateCompact(false);\n    }\n});\nEvent.once(group.onWillDispose)(() => {\n    groupDisposable.dispose();\n});\n```\n```suggestion\n\t\t\tconst groupDisposable = group.onDidActiveEditorChange(() => {\n\t\t\t\tif (group.count > 1) {\n\t\t\t\t\tupdateCompact(false); // leave compact mode when more than 1 editor is active\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t\tEvent.once(group.onWillDispose)(() => {\n\t\t\t\tgroupDisposable.dispose();\n\t\t\t});\n```"

However, there's a subtle issue: if multiple cells are created and disposed rapidly (e.g., during scrolling in a large notebook), each cell creates a new window-level listener. While these are disposable, they remain active until the cell is explicitly disposed.\n\nConsider adding a comment to clarify that the disposal is handled automatically via `this._register()`, or verify that this pattern follows the codebase conventions for window-level event listeners."

However, when the `className` attribute is used, it expects a string value and will automatically split on '.' internally. The current approach of joining with ' ' (space) is less common. Consider using `ThemeIcon.asClassNameArray(Codicon.forward)` directly without `.join(' ')` if multiple classes need to be preserved, or leverage the fact that the `h()` function handles className properly. Looking at line 2039-2044 in `dom.ts`, the function splits `className` on '.' and adds each as a separate class. To apply multiple classes properly when they're in an array, you should either join them with spaces (as done here) or use spread syntax with `classList.add()`.

I've reverted all changes in commit 8ec7770.\n\nThe original restrictions were correct. The workbench grid architecture genuinely prevents panel maximization with non-center alignments because:\n\n1. When the panel is justified/left/right aligned, sidebars are positioned relative to the panel structure (not the editor)\n2. When `toggleMaximizedPanel()` hides the editor, the grid doesn't know how to properly expand the panel in this configuration\n3. This causes the broken layout you observed\n\nSupporting justified panel maximization would require significant refactoring of the grid layout system to handle these different positioning relationships. The original comments warning about this limitation were accurate."

Actually, upon closer inspection, `item.children?.length` returns `undefined` when `children` is undefined, and `0` when it's an empty array - both are falsy, so the logic is correct.

This is a much simpler and cleaner solution that prevents the issue at its root cause. Tree items are already navigable with arrow keys, so checkboxes don't need to be tab stops. See commit ec35b90."

I've updated the approach to generate UUIDs in the renderer only (when commands start) and communicate them to the ptyHost via `setNextCommandId`. This ensures both renderer and ptyHost use the same ID, which is then properly serialized and restored after reload.\n\nThe fix is in commit 281494f where I added a listener in `terminalInstance.ts` that generates IDs for manually-run commands and syncs them to both the renderer's and ptyHost's shell integration addons."

Additionally, calling `setNextCommandId` after the command has started is too late - it needs to be called before the command starts. Consider using `onCommandExecuted` instead, or better yet, generate the ID proactively when the prompt is ready for input rather than reactively after the command has started."

In `acceptDeferred`, `_doAccept()` is called before returning the callback, but in `rejectDeferred`, `_notifySessionAction('rejected')` is called before `_doReject()`. This creates a timing issue where the rejection notification is sent before the actual rejection operation completes. Move `_notifySessionAction('rejected')` inside the returned callback (after line 255) to match the accept pattern and ensure the notification is only sent after the rejection successfully completes.\n\nSee below for a potential fix:\n```\n\t\tawait this._doReject();\n\n\t\treturn (tx: ITransaction) => {\n\t\t\tthis._stateObs.set(ModifiedFileEntryState.Rejected, tx);\n\t\t\tthis._autoAcceptCtrl.set(undefined, tx);\n\t\t\tthis._notifySessionAction('rejected');\n```"

Since `edits[0]` has type `TextEdit | ICellEditOperation`, and only `ICellReplaceEdit` (a subset of `ICellEditOperation`) has a `cells` property, this check may not work as intended. The `hasKey` type guard is designed for discriminating union types where the key exists in at least one member of the union. However, `cells` only exists in `ICellReplaceEdit`, not in all `ICellEditOperation` types. A more robust approach would be to check for a property that exists on all notebook edits, such as `editType`, or continue using the `in` operator which is semantically correct for runtime property checking.\n```suggestion\n\t\tconst isNotebookEdits = edits.length > 0 && 'cells' in edits[0];\n```"
