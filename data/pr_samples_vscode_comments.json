When the widget initially renders, it will be sized based only on the docs height (line 216)\n2. When the async markdown rendering completes, it will resize to include both type and docs heights (line 191)\n\nThis could cause:\n- The widget to be too small initially if there's a type/detail section\n- A visible resize/jump when the async callback fires\n- Incorrect height calculation when there's both detail and documentation\n\nConsider updating line 216 to match line 191's calculation: `this.layout(this._size.width, this._type.clientHeight + this._docs.clientHeight)`.

Second call with custom config like `{'.exe': false}` → cacheKey = `'.exe:0|'`, cache stores filtered extensions  \n3. Third call with `undefined` config → cacheKey = `undefined`, matches the cached key from step 1, returns cached result ✓\n\nWait, this actually works correctly because the cache is a single key-value pair. When step 2 overwrites the cache, step 3 won't match and will recompute.\n\nHowever, there's a different subtle issue: if two different non-undefined configs accidentally produce the same cache key representation (which is impossible with the current implementation since we sort keys and include values), or if someone calls with an empty object `{}` vs `undefined`, they would produce different cache ke",

However, fonts like Segoe UI and San Francisco reserve invisible space for ascenders and descenders, causing text to appear visually lower than the center even when mathematically aligned.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, I implemented a solution using `transform` and `line-height`.\r\n\r\n## My Solution: `transform` + `line-height`\r\n\r\n### 1. `transform: translateY(-1px)` on the Label\r\n\r\n*   **Its Purpose** It moves the text up by 1 pixel at the compositor level.\r\n*   **Safety:** It does **not** trigger a layout recalculation (reflow). It does not change the height of the status bar. It does not affect the position of neighboring items. It is purely visual.\r\n*   **Fragility:** Low. It is an integer pixel shift, which renders cleanly on all screens (no sub-pixel blurring).\r\n\r\n### 2. `transform: translateY(1px)` on the Icon ",

The changes are accurate and minimal:\n\n**Changes (2 files):**\n1. `chatAgents.ts`: Added `_updateChatEnabledState()` that sets `ChatContextKeys.enabled = _hasDefaultAgentImpl && defaultAccountStatus === 'available'`\n2. `inlineChat.ts`: Added `chatIsEnabled` check to inline chat context keys\n\n**Coverage verified (all blocked when defaultAccount !== 'available'):**\n- Chat panel actions (60+ usages)\n- Inline chat actions\n- Notebook, terminal, debug, SCM chat integrations  \n- MCP commands\n\n**Issue fixed:** Context listener now correctly calls `_updateChatEnabledState()` when `defaultAccountStatus` changes (commit 338e8d2)",

A `markAsDisposed(this)` call in the `dispose()` method\n\nSuggested implementation:\n```typescript\nclass DisposableCallback<T> implements IDisposable {\n\tprivate _cb: ((e: T) => void) | undefined;\n\tprivate _isDisposed = false;\n\n\tconstructor(cb: (e: T) => void) {\n\t\tthis._cb = cb;\n\t\ttrackDisposable(this);\n\t}\n\n\tdispose(): void {\n\t\tif (this._isDisposed) {\n\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t}\n\t\tthis._isDisposed = true;\n\t\tmarkAsDisposed(this);\n\t\tthis._cb = undefined;\n\t}\n\n\treadonly handler = (val: T) => {\n\t\treturn this._cb?.(val);\n\t};\n}\n```\n\nNote: You'll need to import `trackDisposable` and `markAsDisposed` from `vs/base/common/lifecycle.js`.",

By calling `toggleMaximizedPanel()` before changing the panel's hidden state, the panel is still visible when `setEditorHidden` checks, avoiding the forced re-showing. Consider clarifying this chain of events in the comment.\n```suggestion\n\t\t// changing visibility. This prevents a conflict with setEditorHidden:\n\t\t// toggleMaximizedPanel() calls setEditorHidden(false), which checks if both editor and panel are hidden,\n\t\t// and if so, forces the panel visible again via setPanelHidden(false, true).\n\t\t// By unmaximizing before hiding, the panel is still visible when setEditorHidden checks,\n\t\t// so it does not force the panel to be shown again",

The format `yyyymmddhh` produces a 10-digit number, but 10-digit numbers do not necessarily fit within int32 bounds (max value: 2,147,483,647). For example, a valid date like `2025123123` (Dec 31, 2025, 23:00) is approximately 2.02 billion, which fits. However, dates from year 2148 onwards (e.g., `2148010100`) would exceed int32 max. While this won't be a practical problem for many decades, the comment is technically misleading. Consider clarifying the comment to state that the format fits within int32 bounds for realistic dates in the foreseeable future, or explain the actual constraint from the ExP service.\n```suggestion\n\t\t// Produces a 10-digit number (yyyymmddhh); this fits within int32 bounds for all realistic release dates (up to year 2147).\n\t\t// Note: Dates from year 2148 onwards would exceed int32, but this is not expected in practice. (ExP requirement)\n```",

The logic is now unified - `CTX_INLINE_CHAT_V2_ENABLED` simply checks `CTX_INLINE_CHAT_HAS_AGENT2` which works for both notebooks and regular editors. Commit: 0623546",

Parallelized queries - even if remote hangs, local extensions load and UI stays responsive\r\n2. \"Install Local Extensions\" now only queries local server, avoiding the hung remote server\r\n\r\nThis won't prevent individual hangs, but stops them from cascading and freezing the entire extension system. Based on #280336's symptoms (empty list, stuck UI), sequential blocking was the culprit.\r\n\r\nHappy to add timeout handling later if needed, but this should resolve the reported issue.\r\nWould you be open to merging this?",

I looked into the VS Code codebase to see how this kind of thing is typically handled.\r\n\r\n## What I found\r\n\r\nI searched through the existing logger creation patterns and filename sanitization in the codebase. A few things stood out:\r\n\r\n**How logger IDs become filenames:**\r\n\r\nIn `src/vs/platform/log/common/log.ts` (lines 653-655), when you pass a string ID, it goes straight into `joinPath()`:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nprotected toResource(idOrResource: string | URI): URI {\r\n    return isString(idOrResource) ? joinPath(this.logsHome, `${idOrResource}.log`) : idOrResource;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's no sanitization or encoding happening there. That's why we hit the Windows path error with characters like `:`, `/`, `?`.\r\n\r\n**Existing patterns:**\r\n\r\nLooking at 50+ logger creation calls across the codebase, they all use simple IDs like `'network'`, `'terminal'`, `'remoteagent'`.

However, there's a subtle issue: if multiple cells are created and disposed rapidly (e.g., during scrolling in a large notebook), each cell creates a new window-level listener. While these are disposable, they remain active until the cell is explicitly disposed.\n\nConsider adding a comment to clarify that the disposal is handled automatically via `this._register()`, or verify that this pattern follows the codebase conventions for window-level event listeners.",

Wait for the widget's viewModel to be set (e.g., by listening to `onDidChangeViewModel`)\n2. Use `chatWidgetService.onDidAddWidget` to wait for the widget registration\n3. Use the `openSession` method from `IChatWidgetService` instead of `editorService.openEditor`, which properly returns the widget\n4. Add error logging when the widget is not found but a prompt was provided\n\nThe old implementation using `chatService.sendRequest` would have thrown an error if the session wasn't found, making failures explicit.\n\nSee below",

The showRange should be an additional constraint. When showRange is specified, the cursor must be within it regardless of other conditions.\n\nThe correct implementation should be:\n```typescript\nconst cursorInsideShowRange = (inlineEditResult.showRange?.containsPosition(cursorPos) ?? true);\n```\n\nThe `cursorAtInlineEdit` check is already implicitly handled by the `cursorPos` being used in the position check, and the explicit check appears on line 630 for a different purpose (to include in the return value).\n```suggestion\n\t\t\tconst cursorInsideShowRange = (inlineEditResult.showRange?.containsPosition(cursorPos)",

The new condition `&& !lastCodeblock` restricts this to only cases without codeblocks. Consider these scenarios:\n1. Content is identical, no codeblocks: Returns `true` ✓\n2.
